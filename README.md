## Overview
### Description
R U BORED? is an iOS mobile application that helps users maintain a high level of productivity by suggesting tasks they can do when they are bored. The application also helps users decide what tasks to do if they have a list of tasks but can't decide what to do first. The app also has reminders that users can implement to remind them to do a task. 
### App Evaluation
- Category: Productivity 
- Mobile: While the app may be viable on a computer, the mobile version of the app would still provide a unique and valuable experience for users. The app could utilize push notifications to remind users about tasks they need to complete, even when they are not actively using the app. Overall, while the app may not rely on sensors, audio, or other advanced mobile features, it still has unique mobile features that make it more than just a glorified website.
- Story: R U BORED app's story is compelling as it offers a solution to a common problem of productivity and decision making. The app's ability to suggest tasks to users when they are bored and help them prioritize their to-do list is a clear value proposition. The app aims to enhance the productivity of its users and make their lives easier by simplifying their decision-making process.
- Market: R U BORED app has a broad target audience. Friends and peers who often find themselves having trouble deciding what to do next could find the app helpful. The app's reminders feature could also appeal to users who struggle with procrastination and forgetfulness.
- Habit: The app is habit-forming. It's designed to be used as often as the user wants, depending on their social life and interests. The app focus on providing suggestions and reminders to help users be more productive. It can provide value when they use it.
Scope: First, we require the users to enter their tasks, then return a random task in that list. The challenging technical aspect of this would be to create an algorithm to return a random task.
